Cormen , Charles E. Leiserson , Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein . Hope to reorganize solutions to help more people and myself study algorithms. By using Markdown (.md) files, it's much more readable on portable devices now. \"Many a little makes a mickle.\" Contributors Thanks to: the Instructor's Manual by Thomas H. Cormen , @skanev , @CyberZHG , @yinyanghu , @ajl213, etc. Special thanks to @JeffreyCA , who fixed MathJax rendering on iOS Safari in #26 . Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed with the sorted solutions. You can simply press the \"Pencil icon\" in the upper right corner to edit the contents or simply open an issue in my repository . Working on following exercises 18.2-1 , 19.2-1 . I will continue to complete VII Selected Topics. How I generate this website I use the static site generator MkDocs and the beautiful theme Material for MkDocs to build this website! Since KaTeX is now supporting more functions and is much faster than MathJax , I've updated all math equations from MathJax to KaTeX . I also add overflow-x: auto to prevent the overflow issue on mobile devices, so you can scroll horizontally in the math display equations. More Informations For more informations please visit my GitHub site .
